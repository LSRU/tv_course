## Introduction

[_R_](https://cran.r-project.org/) is a powerful language for data science in many disciplines of research with a steep learning curve. 
The [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) group of packages provide a dialect that greatly simplifies:

- data importing
- cleaning
- processing
- visualization as well as providing reproducible workflows using pipelines (`%>%`)

Adopt [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), Chief Scientist at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/), philosophy: take each step of data science and  replace many intricacies of _R_ with clear, consistent and easy to learn syntax.
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) will be the software to use since it eases package management, scripting, plotting and data handling.

The four day course provides a complete introduction to data science in _R_ with the **tidyverse**. 
The course will not go deep into statistics but rather getting data ready, some exploratory analysis, visualization and handling models. 

**Preparing data** takes up to 90% of the time spent in analysis — speeding this up is the mission of this course.

### Tidyverse

The **tidyverse** is an official [CRAN package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse) and its [manifesto](http://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/manifesto.html). 
Hadley proposed workflow is described as follow in his must-read book [_R_ for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

In terms of _R_ packages, the workflow is nicely depicted as in this

## Requirements


### Prior knowledge

Participants should have **basic experience** in programming environments such as Matlab, Octave or other programming languages
or complete a simple free online course as [this one](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) offered by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).


### Material

Each student must bring their **own laptop** with _R_ and Rstudio installed with recent versions. Please look at [install tutorial](install_tutorial.html) to set it up prior to the course.

## Schedule


### Dates and time

From: **2nd May** to **5th May** 2017.


Each day, the workshop will be a mixture of lectures and practicals from:

- 9h30 - 12h30
- 13h30 - 18h

Coffee breaks will serve at each morning and afternoon sessions.

### Program

- **Day 1** will review the basics of `R` and loading data via the `readr` package as well as `Rmarkdown`. 
-	**Day 2** will introduce tidying and organising data via the `tidyr` and `dplyr` packages as well as `ggplot2` for visualisation. 
-	**Day 3** will look at functional programming tools using the `purrr` package, which greatly simplifies repeating operations. 
Many statistical packages have complicated and idiosyncratic data structures. The `broom` package helps to convert them to consistent data structures. 
-	Participants are encouraged to bring their own data for analysis, convert existing code to **tidyverse** or perform a project on **Day 4**.
