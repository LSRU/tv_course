## Introduction

[_R_](https://cran.r-project.org/) is a powerful language for data science in many disciplines of research with a steep learning curve. 
The [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) group of packages provide a dialect that greatly simplifies:

- data importing
- cleaning
- processing
- visualization as well as providing reproducible workflows using pipelines (`%>%`)

Adopt [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), Chief Scientist at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/), philosophy: take each step of data science and  replace many intricacies of _R_ with clear, consistent and easy to learn syntax.
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) will be the software to use since it eases package management, scripting, plotting and data handling.

The four day course provides a complete introduction to data science in _R_ with the **tidyverse**. 
The course will not go deep into statistics but rather getting data ready, some exploratory analysis, visualization and handling models. 

**Preparing data** takes up to 90% of the time spent in analysis â€” speeding this up is the mission of this course.

## Tidyverse

The **tidyverse** is an official [CRAN package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse) and its [manifesto](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html). 
Hadley proposed workflow is described as follow in his must-read book [_R_ for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

In terms of _R_ packages, the workflow is nicely depicted as in this

## Requirements

Participants should have **basic experience** in programming environments such as Matlab, Octave or other programming languages
or complete a simple free online course as [this one](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) offered by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

Each student must bring their **own laptop** with _R_ and Rstudio installed with recent versions. Please look at [install tutorial](install_tutorial.html) to set it up prior to the course.

## Schedule, location

From: **2nd May** to **5th May** 2017.

- Day 1 will review the basics of `R` and loading data via the `readr` package as well as `Rmarkdown`. 
-	Day 2 will introduce tidying and organising data via the `tidyr` and `dplyr` packages as well as `ggplot2` for visualisation. 
-	Day 3 will look at functional programming tools using the `purrr` package, which greatly simplifies repeating operations. 
Many statistical packages have complicated and idiosyncratic data structures. The `broom` package helps to convert them to consistent data structures. 
-	Participants are encouraged to bring their own data for analysis, convert existing code to **tidyverse** or perform a project on Day 4.


The course will be held at:
University of Luxembourg
Esch-sur-Alzette
Luxembourg
See map: [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/?q=11%2C+porte+des+Sciences+%2C+Esch-sur-Alzette%2C+%2C+%2C+lu)

In the Salle polyvalente, Maison du Savoir, 1st floor.

## Registration

the course is limited to 25 participants. Register through [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/KVq5ek5PcStkrAK92)


## ECTS

PhD students that enrolled through the doctoral school will receive **2 ECTS** in category 1, which requires handing in a short report at the end of the course.
