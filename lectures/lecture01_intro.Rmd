## Reading


- Excellent recent ressource about `R` by [Ewen Gallic](http://egallic.fr/Enseignement/R/m1_stat_eco_logiciel_R.pdf)
- [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund

## What is R? {.vs2}

"R" is shorthand for ["GNU R"](https://www.r-project.org):

- An interactive programming language
- Focus on data analysis ("stats") and plotting
- "R" is also shorthand for the ecosystem around this language
    + Book authors
    + Package developers
    + Ordinary useRs
  
Learning to use R will make you **more efficient** and **facilitate the use** of advanced data analysis tools

## Why use R? {.vs2}

- It's *free!*
- easy to install / maintain
- easy to process big files and analyse huge amounts of data
- integrated data visualisation tools, *even dynamic*
- fast, and even faster with *C++* integration via [Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp/Rcpp-attributes.pdf).
- easy to get help
    + [huge R community in the web](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552336-Getting-Help-with-R)
    + [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) with a lot of tags like **dplyr**, **ggplot2** etc.
    + [rbloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com)

```

In **Rstudio**, the help page can be viewed in the bottom right pane

```{r}
apropos("log")
```

## Drawback: Steep learning curve | Period of much suckiness

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/vembedr")
vembedr::embed_youtube("8SGif63VW6E", query = list(start = vembedr::secs("4m12s"), end = vembedr::secs("4m52s")))
```

## Tidyverse | creator {.vs2}

**R base** is complex, [**tidyverse**](http://tidyverse.org/) is better.


### Hadley Wickham {.box .col-8}

[Hadley](http://had.co.nz), chief scientist at **Rstudio**, coined the _tidyverse_ at [userR meeting in 2016](https://twitter.com/drob/status/748196885307920385).
He developed and maintains most of the core _tidyverse_ packages

### {.col-4}

```


## Tidyverse  | packages {.vs1}

## Tidyverse criticism  | dialect {.vs1}

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/ucfagls">@ucfagls</a> yeah. I think the tidyverse is a dialect. But its accent isn’t so thick</p>&mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/819610201946984451">12 janvier 2017</a></blockquote>

## Tidyverse criticism | controversy

[SO's comment](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41880796/grouped-multicolumn-gather-with-dplyr-tidyr-purrr)

![](img/01_tidyverse_contreversy.png)

See the popularity of the [data.table versus dplyr](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21435339/data-table-vs-dplyr-can-one-do-something-well-the-other-cant-or-does-poorly) question.

Easily summarised: [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) is faster, for less than 10 m rows, negligible.

## Tidyverse criticism  | jobs {.vs2}

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="fr"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Realized today: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse?src=hash">#tidyverse</a> R and base <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash">#rstats</a> have little in common. Beware when looking for  job which requires knowledge of R.</p>&mdash; Yeedle N. (@Yeedle) <a href="https://twitter.com/Yeedle/status/837448170963668992">2 mars 2017</a></blockquote>

Anyway, learning the _tidyverse_ does not prevent to learn _R base_, it helps to get things done early in the process

# RStudio

![](./img/01_logo_RStudio.png)

## Rstudio | What is it?

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) is an Integrated Development Environment.  
It makes working with R much easier

### Features {.col-9 .box .bg-green}

>- _Console_ to run **R**, with syntax highlighter
>- _Editor_ to work with scripts
>- _Viewer_ for data / plots / website
>- _Package management_ (including building)
>- _autocompletion_ using <kbd>TAB</kbd>
>- [_Cheatsheets_](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
>- _git_ integration for versioning
>- _inline_ outputs (>= v1.03)
>- _Keyboard shortcuts_

### Warning {.col-3 .box .bg-orange}
Don't mix up **R** and **RStudio**.  
**R** needs to be installed first.

## Rstudio | The 4 panels layout

![](./img/01_rstudio_layout.jpg)



## Getting started

Let's get ready to use **R** and **RStudio**. Do the following:

- Open up RStudio
- Maximise the RStudio window
- Click the Console pane, at the prompt (`>`) type in `3 + 2` and hit enter

```{r, eval = FALSE, prompt = TRUE}
3 + 2
```

## Arithmetic operations

You will not be surprised that **R** is very good at computing

### arithmetic operators {.col-8 .bg-green}

- `+`: addition  
- `-`: subtraction  
- `*`: multiplication  
- `/`: division  
- `^` or `**`: exponentiation 
- `%%`: modulo (remainder after division)
- `%/%`: integer division

### Remember {.col-8 .bg-orange}

 **R** will:

- first perform **exponentiation**
- then multiplications and/or divisions
- and finally additions and/or subtractions.

If you need to change the priority during the evaluation, use parentheses – _i.e._ `(` and `)` – to group calculations.

## Rstudio | Working directory and projects

### Working directory

It is where **R** is looking for files (read or write).  
Using the console, try:

```{r, prompt = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
getwd()
```

- It is possible to change the location using `setwd()` (in the console or interactively in _RStudio_)
- A better way is to use projects in Rstudio

### Projects

They solve most issues with working directories: get rid of `setwd()`

# Data types and structures

## 4 main types

Type          | Example
------------- | ---------------------------
numeric       | integer (2), double (2.34)
string        | "tidyverse !"
boolean       | TRUE / FALSE
complex       | 2+0i

### Special case

```{r, eval = FALSE}
NA   # not available, missing data
NA_real_
NA_integer_
NA_character_
NA_complex_
NULL # empty
```

## Structures

>- Vectors
>- Factors
>- Matrix (2D), Arrays ($\geq$ 3D)
>- Lists
>- Data frames


## Data types 2

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# evaluate
typeof(2)
# check
is.integer(2.34)
# convert
as.integer(2.34)
```

## Vectors

**Vectors** are the simplest type of "object" in R.
```{r}
print(5)
```

**[1]** means we made a numeric vector of length 1.
Now look at what the **`:`** operator does:

```{r}
1:30
```

How many elements are in the thing we made here? What does the **[24]** signify?

##

Think of vectors as collections of simple things (like numbers) that are ordered. We can create vectors from other vectors using the **`c`** function:

```{r}
c(2, TRUE, "a string")
```

We can use the assignment operator to associate a name to our vectors in order to reuse them:
```{r}
myvec <- c(3, 4, 1:3)
myvec
```

##

The following will build a character vector. We know this because the elements are all in quotes.

```{r}
char.vec <- c("dog", "cat", "ape")
```

Now use the **`c`** function to combine a length-one vector number of the number `4` with the `char.vec`. What happens?

```{r}
c(4, char.vec)
```

Notice that the 4 is quoted. R turned it into a character vector and then combined it with char.vec.   All the elements in a vector must be of the same type.

##

R has a few built in vectors. One of these is `LETTERS`. What does it contain?

```{r}
LETTERS
```

How do extract the first element from this (the letter A). Here is how to do it:

```{r}
LETTERS[1]
```

Use the square brakets to subset vectors

##

What do we do if we need more than one element? Here is how to get elements in position 3 through to 10:

```{r}
LETTERS[3:10]
```

Remember what the : operator does? Take a look:

```{r}
3:10
```

Can you see how `LETTERS[3:10]` works now?

##

Exercise

- find a way to output the following
```{r, echo = FALSE}
LETTERS[2:5]
```

- find a way to output the following
```{r, echo = FALSE}
LETTERS[c(2:5, 7)]
```

- find a way to output first 5 letters + one to the last
```{r, echo = FALSE}
LETTERS[c(1:5, length(LETTERS) - 1)]
```


##

Solution

```{r, eval = FALSE}
LETTERS[2:5]
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
LETTERS[c(2:5, 7)]
```
```{r, eval = TRUE}
LETTERS[c(1:5, length(LETTERS) - 1)]
```

## Vectorized operation

```{r}
myvec <- 10:18
myvec + 2
```

**R** recycles vectors that are too short:

```{r}
myvec * c(1:3)
```

## Vectorized operation

Have a look at the following operation:

```{r}
c(1:3) + c(1:2) * c(1:4)
```

The detailed steps _R_ performs _behind the scene_ are:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
c(1, 2, 3, 1) + (c(1, 2, 1, 2) * c(1, 2, 3, 4))
c(1, 2, 3, 1) + c(1, 4, 3, 8)
```

## Factors

Vectors with qualitative data

```{r}
factor(c("cytoplasm", "nucleus", "extracellular", "nucleus", "nucleus"))
```

## Matrix

A matrix is a **2D** array

```{r}
M <- matrix(1:6, ncol = 2, nrow = 3)
M
```
```{r}
M <- matrix(1:6, ncol = 2, nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
M
```

## Array

Similar to a matrix but with dimensions $\geq$ 3D

```{r}
A <- array(1:24, dim = c(2, 4, 3))
A
```

## Lists

Most permissive type. Could be anything!
```{r}
l <- list(name = "Farina", firstname = "Geoff", year = 1995)
```
<div class = "float-r">![](./img/hadley_pepper.png)</div>
```{r}
l["firstname"]
l[["firstname"]]
```

Have a look at [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/lists.html) for a description of the analogy by Hadley Wickham.

## Data frame

It's the most important type to recall.  
`ggplot2` and `dplyr` are focusing on those.

```{r}
women
```

## Convert to a data frame

The function `as.data.frame()` allows to convert a matrix / list into a `data.frame`.  
A data frame can be considered as a collection of vectors having the **same length**.

We can extract a vector from a data frame in a few different ways:

```{r}
# Using the name and the $ operator
women$height
# using [[]], name in quotes or indices
women[["height"]]
```

Remember the analogy introduced by Hadley Wickham to explain lists indexing:  The _pepper shaker_ also applies to data frames.
What would be the output of `women["height"]`?

## Data frame as a table

A data frame can be considered as a table and extract a specify a cell by its `row` and `column`:

```{r}
head(women, 5)
women[4, 2] # [row, col]
```

## Logical operators

In addition to the arithmetic operators (that were already presented) R provides the possiblity to perform comparisons:

* `==` equal
* `!=` different
* `<` smaller
* `<=` smaller **or** equal
* `>` greater
* `>=` greater **or** equal
* `!` is not
* `&`, `&&` and
* `|`, `||` or

## Logical operators | Subtle differences

The **double logicals** (`||` and `&&`) are **not** vectorized compared to the single ones (`|` and `&`).

```{r}
((-2:2) >= 0) & ((-2:2) <= 0)
((-2:2) >= 0) && ((-2:2) <= 0)
```

The double-character version evaluates only the first elements of each vector!

see section [8.2.17 in R inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf)

## Identifying missing data

```{r}
v <- c(1:3, NA, NA, 5:8, NA)
v
is.na(v)
```

```{r}
which(is.na(v)) # Extract index of NA values
v[!is.na(v)]    # Return vector elements which are not NA
```


## Style

`R` is rather flexible and permissive with its syntax. However, being more strict tends to ease the debugging process.

See [Hadley's recommendations](http://style.tidyverse.org/)

In summary:

- use **spaces**
- use more **lines**
    + `}` alone on their line except for
      ```{r, eval = FALSE}
      } else {
      ```
    + using the pipe `%>%` to display a single instruction per line
    + break list definitions, function arguments ...
- avoid using names of existing functions and variables
  
```{r}
# Bad (example from http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
T <- FALSE
c <- 10
mean <- function(x) sum(x)
```
